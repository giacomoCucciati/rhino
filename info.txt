This software was developed to offer the well known abilities of Tasso in a more "user-friendly" GUI. 
By now only Tasso standard functionalities are implemented but soon or later also the most advanced ones will be added.
Try it!

Read MANUAL.TXT for all the instruction...

Help us to impreve this software: report for bugs, suggest implementations or just ask for more information at giacomo.cucciati@gmail.com.
Maybe I could even answer!


Special thanks to Oliviero Cremonesi as author of Tasso.
